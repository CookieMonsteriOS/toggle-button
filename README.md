Exercise to create toggle button

Your task is to create a toggle button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The button should have two states: "On" and "Off." Clicking the button should toggle between these two states. When the button is in the "On" state, its background color should be green, and when it's in the "Off" state, its background color should be gray.

Your task is to:

Create an HTML structure for the toggle button.
Style the button using CSS to represent the "On" and "Off" states with appropriate colors.
Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the button. When clicked, the button's state should toggle between "On" and "Off," and its background color should change accordingly.
